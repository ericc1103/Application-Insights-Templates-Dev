# Data Sources in Workbooks

Workbooks can query data from a lot the common sources of telemetry in Azure. Workbook authors can transform this data in interesting way to provide insights into the availability, performance, usage and success of the underlying components. For instance, they could analyze performance logs from virtual machines to identify high CPU or low memory instances and show the results as a grid in an interactive report. 

Workbooks also allow users to combine data from multiple sources with a single report to allow composite resource views or joins across resources to get richer data.

Workbooks support these data sources:
* [Logs](#logs)
* [Metrics](#metrics)
* [Azure Resource Graph](#azure-resource-graph)
* [Alerts](#alerts)
* [Workload Health](#workload-health)
* [Azure Resource Health](#azure-resource-health)
* [Custom Endpoint](#custom-endpoint)

## Logs
Workbooks support getting analytics logs data. Examples of logs include app requests, exceptions, dependencies, traces, etc. in App Insights, or VM perf logs in Log Analytics. Workbooks allow authors to get analytics data using KQL queries and present the insights to users in a visual form.

Workbooks allows querying logs from these sources:
1.	Log Analytics Workspace (LA)
2.	Application Insights Resource (AI)
3.	Resource-centric data (e.g. logs for a VM)

Workbook authors can use KQL queries that transform the underlying resource data to select a result set that can visualized as text, charts or grids.

Authors can also have their queries target more than one resources to get very powerful unions and joins across components. For instance, you can union virtual machine performance summaries from two different Log Analytics workspaces in a workbook. 

This ability to make arbitrary queries using KQL, along with the visualization and customization capabilities of workbooks provides authors with a powerful toolset for building rich reports and experiences for data analysis. 

## Metrics
Azure resources emit metrics that can be accessed via workbooks. Examples of metrics include CPU utilization and disk read rates of VMs, or DTU % of a database. These metrics can be accessed in workbooks via a specialized control that allows you to specify the target resources, interesting metrics and their aggregation. This data can then be plotted in charts or grids.

## Azure Resource Graph (ARG)
Workbooks  support querying for resources and their metadata using Azure Resource Graph (ARG). This is primarily used to build custom query scopes for reports. The resource scope is expressed via a KQL-subset that ARG supports â€“ which is usually enough the common use cases.

To make a query control use this data source, use the _Query Type_ drop down to choose _Azure Resource Graph_ and select the subscriptions to target. Use the _Query_ control to add the ARG KQL-subset that selects an interesting resource subset.

## Alerts
Workbooks allow users to visualize the active alerts related to their resources. This allows the creation of reports that bring together notification data (alert) and diagnostic information (metrics, logs) into one report. This information can also be joined together to create rich reports that combines insights across these data sources. 

To make a query control use this data source, use the _Query Type_ drop down to choose _Alerts_ and select the subscriptions, resource groups or resources to target. Use the alert filter drop downs to select an interesting subset of alerts for your analytic needs.

## Workload Health
Azure Monitor has functionality that proactively monitors the availability and performance of Windows or Linux guest OSes with a model that represent key components and their relationships, criteria that specifies how to measure the health of those components, and which can alert you when an unhealthy condition is detected. Workbooks allow users to use this information to create rich reports.

To make a query control use this data source, use the _Query Type_ drop down to choose _Workload Health_ and select subscription, resource group or VM resources to target. Use the health filter drop downs to select an interesting subset of health incidents for your analytic needs.

## Azure Resource Health
Workbooks supports getting Azure resource health and combining it with other data sources to create rich, interactive health reports

To make a query control use this data source, use the _Query Type_ drop down to choose _Azure health_ and select the resources to target. Use the health filter drop downs to select an interesting subset of resource issues for your analytic needs.

## Custom endpoint
Workbooks supports getting data from any external source. If your data lives outside Azure you can bring it to Workbooks by using this data source type.

To make a query control use this data source, use the _Query Type_ drop down to choose _Custom Endpoint_. Provide the appropriate parameters such as Http method, url, headers, url parameters and/or body. Make sure your data source supports [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) otherwise the request will fail.

To avoid automatically making calls to un-trusted hosts when using templates, the users needs to mark the used hosts as trusted. This can be done by either clicking on the _Add as trusted_ button, or by adding it as a trusted host in Workbook settings. This settings will be saved in browsers that support IndexDb with web workers, more info [here](https://caniuse.com/#feat=indexeddb).

`Note:  Do not write any secrets in any of the fields (headers, parameters, body, url), since they will be visible to all of the Workbook users.`


## Merge data from different sources
It is often necessary to bring together data from different sources that enhance the insights experience. An example is augmenting active alert information with related metric data. This allows users to see not just the effect (an active alert), but also potential causes (e.g. high CPU usage). The monitoring domain has numerous such correlatable data sources that are often critical to the triage and diagnostic workflow. 

Workbooks allow not just the querying of different data sources, but also provides simple controls that allow you to merge or join the data to provide rich insights. The `merge` control is the way to achieve it. 

The example below combines alerting data with log analytics VM performance data where available to get a rich insights grid.

Workbooks support a variety of merge flavors:
* Inner unique join
* Full inner join
* Full outer join
* Left outer join
* Right outer join
* Left semi-join
* Right semi-join
* Left anti-join
* Right anti-join
* Union
* Duplicate table
